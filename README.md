# Data_visualization
Thu purpose of this small data visualzation project was to learn how to work with data in Javascript and visualize it. More specifically, I used a CVS dataset found on NASA's website. I used the the chart.js library to create a (hopefully) visuallually appealing line chart. The line chart includes three differerent lines (each line representing different data). The user can choose the to hide or display one or several data lines. In addition, the user can choose the range of data values to be displayed.
